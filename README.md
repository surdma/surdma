Excellent. Below is your **merged, elite-tier GitHub profile README** — blending your aesthetic power with a sharp, high-authority narrative that sells you as a *system builder*, not just a developer.

It retains your visual appeal (capsules, icons, graphs) while infusing the confident, professional tone and architectural depth that will attract clients, recruiters, and collaborators alike.

# 👋 Hey, I'm Surdma

I'm a **Full-Stack Engineer & Backend Architect** focused on building **scalable, production-grade systems** across web, mobile, and IoT platforms.  
I design and engineer solutions that merge **high performance**, **clean architecture**, and **real-world impact** — from REST and GraphQL APIs to real-time streaming infrastructures.

My core stack is **Python (FastAPI, Django)** and **TypeScript (NestJS, Next.js)**, with deep experience integrating **microservices**, **payments**, **caching**, and **real-time communication** layers.

When I’m not building systems, I’m usually exploring new technologies, mentoring developers, or sharing my process through **open-source projects**, **tech articles**, and **live coding sessions**.
